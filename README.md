## the idea

It's the idea to create a wireless split keyboard with the [size of a credit card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_7810#ID-1) for each half.

## this fork

This fork changes the board to use [Seeed XIAO controllers](https://www.seeedstudio.com/xiao-series-page) instead of the ProMicro-compatible controllers normally used.
